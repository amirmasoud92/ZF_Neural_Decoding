| **Fig 1**  | Overview of the experimental setup, neural signal processing pipeline (LFP/MUAe), and architecture of the BiLSTM neural decoder. Also introduces the four temporal features decoded: **Song Events**, **Amplitude Envelope**, **Peak Rate**, and **Peak Envelope**. |
| **Fig 2**  | Example decoding performance from one bird and trial. Shows decoded vs. actual temporal features using LFP input. The decoder accurately reconstructs **syllable segments**, **envelopes**, and **temporal landmarks**.                                             |
| **Fig 3**  | Comparative decoding performance using LFP vs. MUAe across all birds and sessions. Highlights decoding accuracy, correlation, and variance explained. Violin plots visualize group-level trends.                                                                    |
| **Fig 4**  | Anatomical localization of decoding performance across the avian auditory pallium. Field L (primary auditory area) consistently shows higher decoding accuracy than secondary regions.                                                                              |
| **Fig 5**  | Links between **single-unit response properties** and decoding performance. Shows that high-performing ensembles are made of neurons with high mutual information and phase-locking to temporal landmarks.                                                          |
| **Fig 6**  | Visualizes internal transformations in the **BiLSTM decoder**. Principal Component Analysis and t-SNE reveal how temporal features emerge through layer-wise processing.                                                                                            |
| **Fig 7**  | Direct comparison between **real neurons** and **artificial decoder units**. Shows that both share similar clustered activity and phase-locked responses to envelope events. Overlaps in t-SNE and DBSCAN clusters confirm functional similarity.                   |
